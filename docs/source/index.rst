Hi!
FlyingFrames is a project by me (kolibril13), where I want to provide you some tutorials and code snippets that I often use when I prepare
my animations for my youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/kolibril
It does not replace the amazing documentation at https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/ , but I hope this blog will
give you some inspiration for your future projects.

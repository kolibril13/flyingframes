- In Mobject basics when talking about position, one thing I think you could talk about before that is what the coordinate system is, e.g. moving 1 right means 1 pixel? Where is the position (0, 0, 0)? Does it include negative values and how can you change the coordinate system if you want it to be 100 x 100 for example. I am still not sure myself how to have more control over the coordinate system so think it would be useful

- For color you could also mention the color parameter that should set both stroke and fill
